# Advent of code
Advent of code solutions between friends and different stacks, a way to gather up creative solutions and to be played like a game!

## What languages can be used?

Any language, the purpose of this game is to gather up as many different solutions as possible independently of their size, complexity or logic.

## How can I participate?

Just submit a pull request and add your solution to one of the days.

## Is this code golfing?

Even though it would be interesting to see short solutions, the intention is not code golfing. It would be unfair to restrict or rank the solutions according to their character length, the aim is to build an interesting count of different approaches, so feel free to add spaces and linebreaks! ðŸ˜„
